V4L/DVB building procedures are based at the use of Makefile rules.
Those rules are close tho the ones at Linux Kernel, to allow an easier
usage.

=======================================================================
Quick building procedure is:
	make all
======================================================================

For those that may want more than just build all stuff there are some
other interesting parameters to make:

======================
Normal building rules:
all		- build all modules

clean		- Cleans compiled files from the tree,
		  but keeping the latest
		  used configuration and kernel version

distclean	- Cleans compiled files from the tree,
		  latest used configuration and kernel
		  version.

default		- Continues building the latest module selection
		  This is the behavior when just typed:
			make

install		- Installs all modules at kernel's default dir
		  for V4L/DVB. Requires root access.

rminstall	- cleans previous installations of V4L/DVB modules

sound-install	- installs the sound modules related to V4L/DVB
		  tree.
